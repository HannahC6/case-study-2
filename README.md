Hello :)

Welcome to my second case study! 

A csv file containing information about Netflix series, both films and shows, was acquired from Kaggle (link: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/maso0dahmed/netflix-movies-and-shows) in May 2024.

An imaginary business task was set to make a full document in the end. 

For simple rankings, SQL was used, but mostly R studio was run to get graphs straight away. 

Due to the nature of the company as well as the industry, it was a shame that more valuable and latest data was not able to access, so this analysis cannot be regarded as the most accurate with high judgement. 

You can find the detailed journey in the uploaded files.

Hope you enjoy them and do not hesitate to hit me up!
